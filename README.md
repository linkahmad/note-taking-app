Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the app locally:

1. Clone the repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/note-taking-app.git
2. Backend Setup (Laravel)
Navigate to the backend folder and install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd note-taking-app/backend
composer install
Create a .env file and set up your database credentials:

bash
Copy code
cp .env.example .env
Generate the application key:

bash
Copy code
php artisan key:generate
Run migrations to create the database tables:

bash
Copy code
php artisan migrate
Seed the database with initial data (optional):

bash
Copy code
php artisan db:seed
Start the backend server:

bash
Copy code
php artisan serve
This will start the Laravel backend at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

3. Frontend Setup (React)
Navigate to the frontend folder and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code

npm install
Start the React development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will start the React frontend at http://localhost:3000.

4. Configure API Endpoint
In the frontend/src/api.js (or similar) file, ensure that the API URL is correctly set to match the backend URL:

javascript
Copy code
const API_URL = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/notes';
